# Wordle-Challenge

A take-home challenge from [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/).

My task was to emulate a feature from the game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

I looked at the game and broke down its features into user stories which I submitted as issues to this repo.

The user story I chose to emulate was 'I want the app to verify that I am entering a real five-letter word before allowing me to submit'.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repo into VS Code using 
```
git clone https://github.com/simonryrie/Wordle-Challenge.git
```
2. Launch the site using the [VS Code LiveServer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

You can also see the app deployed on [GitHub Pages](simonryrie.github.io/Wordle-Challenge/) .
